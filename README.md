# primeproduct
This repository holds the multiplication table of prime numbers
# How to use this application
### Navigate to https://codepen.io/oseun/pen/RwNqroL
### Ensure you only type in numbers from 2 upwards
### If you type in a number that is not a prime number, the function will only generate prime numbers before that number.
### The function takes in numbers only.
### You can type in any number you want but for reasons due to scalability and size, the table starts getting messy from 120 and above
